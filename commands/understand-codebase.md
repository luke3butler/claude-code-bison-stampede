# Deep Dive: Understanding the Codebase

Take a step back and deeply understand this codebase by exploring these questions:

## Questions to Investigate

1. **Architecture & Design**
   - How do the different services communicate with each other?
   - What are the key data flows through the system?
   - Are there any circular dependencies or architectural smells?
   - How is state managed across different components?

2. **Integration Points**
   - How do external services and APIs integrate with the application?
   - What's the relationship between different modules and components?
   - How do third-party libraries or services connect to the system?
   - Where are the boundaries between services?

3. **Data Flow**
   - How does data flow from input to processing to output?
   - What data storage solutions are used and for what purposes?
   - How are requests tracked, logged, or monitored?
   - What's the lifecycle of key workflows or processes?

4. **Hidden Complexity**
   - What assumptions are baked into the code?
   - Are there any implicit dependencies?
   - What edge cases might not be handled?
   - Where might performance bottlenecks occur?

5. **Development Experience**
   - What makes development easy or hard in this codebase?
   - Are there patterns that could be extracted or reused?
   - What's missing from the developer tooling?

## Action Items

1. Pick 2-3 questions that seem most important or unclear
2. Use search and code reading to find concrete answers
3. Challenge any assumptions you've made
4. Update your mental model of how the system works
5. Document any surprising findings or insights
6. Note any potential improvements or concerns

Remember: The goal is to build a deeper, more accurate understanding of the system's actual behavior, not just its intended design.
